                <p>
                    Cristiano Ronaldo was born into a humble family in Santo António, a working-class neighborhood on
                    the Portuguese island of Madeira. His father, <strong>José Dinis Aveiro</strong>, worked as a
                    gardener and a kit man for
                    a local football club, while his mother, <strong>Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro</strong>, worked as
                    a cook and cleaner to
                    support the family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ronaldo was the youngest of four siblings — <strong>Hugo, Elma, and Liliana “Kátia”</strong>.
                    Despite their financial
                    struggles, his family supported his love for football from the beginning. He started playing for the
                    local team Andorinha at the age of 7, where his father was the kit man. Later, he joined Nacional,
                    another
                    local club, before moving to mainland Portugal to join Sporting CP’s academy at just <strong>12
                        years old</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The move was difficult — he was far from his family and struggled to adapt to the new environment —
                    but his talent and determination stood out. At age 15, he was diagnosed with a heart condition
                    called
                    <strong>tachycardia</strong>, which could have ended his career before it started. He underwent
                    surgery and made a full recovery,
                    returning stronger than ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, Ronaldo’s second name — Ronaldo — was inspired by former U.S. President Ronald
                    Reagan, whom his father admired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even in his early days, Ronaldo was known for his extreme dedication to training. His coaches often
                    said he
                    stayed after sessions to perfect his skills — a habit that would later define his legendary career.
